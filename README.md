To use this implementation with our server, download Client folder (without the old test codes)

To use this with a different server, use codes from Server folder on the server pi and codes in Client in client pi/arduinos

All of the codes for controlling & recording from microcontrollers (including EEG classification program) is in "Microcontroller Codes" folder
